# Build locally, upload with gh — electron-builder's GitHub publisher races
# against itself (duplicate publisher tasks re-upload the same assets and
# overwrite each other), leaving release assets inconsistent with
# latest-mac.yml. Building with --publish never and uploading the finished
# artifacts in one gh call is deterministic: one build state, one upload.
#
# Note: package.json declares arch:["arm64","x64"] in its targets, so a single
# electron-builder run builds both arches — never run it once per arch.
